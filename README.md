SyncPay: An Autonomous AI B2B Payments Agent
üåü Project Overview
SyncPay is an intelligent, autonomous AI agent designed to revolutionize business-to-business (B2B) payments for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs). By leveraging the speed of the Sei blockchain and the financial protocols of Yei Finance, SyncPay eliminates the manual complexities of accounts payable. It acts as a dedicated digital accountant, ensuring payments are executed flawlessly while optimizing a business's on-chain treasury.

üöÄ Core Functionality
SyncPay's core purpose is to create a seamless "flow" of payments, synchronizing every aspect of the accounts payable process.

Autonomous Invoice Monitoring and Processing
SyncPay connects to a business's designated email or cloud storage to vigilantly observe for new invoices. Using a sophisticated large language model (LLM), it accurately extracts critical data‚Äîvendor name, invoice number, due date, and amount owed‚Äîfrom various invoice formats. This data is cross-referenced with pre-approved vendor lists to prevent fraud and ensure validity.

Intelligent Payment Scheduling
Based on the extracted due date and the business's pre-defined payment policies (e.g., "pay within 7 days of receipt"), SyncPay automatically schedules the corresponding stablecoin payment on the Sei blockchain. This completely eliminates the risk of late payments and the need for manual calendar management.

Treasury Optimization with Yei Finance
This is where SyncPay's "synchronization" truly shines. Rather than letting a business's funds sit idle, SyncPay integrates directly with the Yei Finance protocol. It can be configured to automatically deposit excess capital into Yei's lending pools to generate passive yield. When a payment is scheduled, SyncPay intelligently withdraws the exact amount needed, just in time for the transaction, ensuring capital is always working for you.

Real-Time Reporting and Audit Trail
SyncPay provides a user-friendly interface that gives business owners a clear, real-time overview of their payments. Users can monitor all scheduled and completed transactions, track their treasury's performance, and receive instant alerts. The immutable nature of the Sei blockchain ensures a permanent and tamper-proof audit trail for all financial activities.

‚öôÔ∏è Technical Components
Agentic Framework: The core logic will be built using an AI agentic framework like ElizaOS or AIDN.

Blockchain Integration: SyncPay will interact directly with the Sei blockchain for all payment transactions, utilizing a library or SDK like the Sei MCP to ensure efficient and secure communication.

LLM Integration: An LLM will be used for natural language processing and invoice data extraction, enabling the agent to understand and interpret unstructured data.

DeFi Protocol Integration: The agent will communicate with Yei Finance's smart contracts via API calls to manage lending pool deposits and withdrawals.

User Interface: A simple, intuitive web interface will allow users to set up their accounts, configure payment rules, and monitor their financial activity.

Notification System: A notification system will alert the business owner of important events.
